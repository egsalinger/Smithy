# Smithy
This is a demo node.js crud app. I'm intending to build it as a toy application to practice new things, not as a production app.

Smithy acts as trouble-ticketing system for my (currently hypothetical) blacksmithing workshop. There's always a lot to do in the shop, and so instead of doing any of that boring work stuff, I'll create an issue management system. That way I can keep track of the work I'm intending to do. 

Smithy is currently intended to act as a series of node.js APIs that talk to a mySQL backend. I fully intend to add a front-end at some point in the near future (using a new, exciting programming language)
It currently runs MySQL 5, and will probably connect with other back-ends in the future.
